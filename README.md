Project Title: Summer Chores

This project keeps track of an individual's strict chore routine.

The individual who would be using this will need to input their name and it will generate a random boolean to see if they have finished their task in the alloted time or not. 

There is a Call Back JS version, Promise Call Back JS version, and an Asyn and Await JS version.
